## SOLUTION
What the project will bring to the community, on the restaurant side, it will provide a complete sales channel for the restaurant that will use the app, I will help the restaurant owners to save spaces needed to serve many customers, It will increase the restaurant profitability since they will be running more time. It will help the restaurant collect orders in a simple way. It will help them to stop worrying about communication errors and streamline their order management workflow. On the Client’s side, it will increase trust between restaurants and clients and it will help customers to order what they want and make payments in without moving from one place to another. This will help both sides to keep the social distancing because of the covid-19. It will help the clients to keep doing their activities as they wait for their order because our project will help them to know the time it will take to receive their order and the distance between the client’s location and the restaurant.
